<title>The Live user</title>
<para>Username FIXME.</para>
<para>One important consideration is that the live user is created by &live-initramfs; during bootup, it is not created by &live-helper; when building the image.</para>

 <para>You can specify additional groups that the live user will belong to by preseeding the <command>passwd/user-default-groups</command> debconf value. For example, to add the live user to the <command>fuse</command> group, add the following to a file in the <filename class="directory">config/chroot_local-preseed</filename> directory:</para>

<screen>
 debconf passwd/user-default-groups string audio cdrom dialout floppy video plugdev netdev powerdev fuse
</screen>

 <para>For more information about debconf preseeding, please see <xref linkend="debconf-preseed"/>.</para>

<section id="language">
<title>Language</title>
<para>When the live system boots there are three process which concerns language: the locale generation, setting the keyboard layout for the console and setting the keyboard layout for X. To define the locale that should be generated, use the <command>locale</command> parameter to the <command>--bootappend-live</command> option of <filename>lh_config</filename>, e.g.:

<screen>lh_config --bootappend-live "locale=sv_SE.utf8"</screen>

Both the console and X keyboard configuration depends on the <command>keyb</command> parameter of the <command>--bootappend-live</command>option. Valid options for X keyboard layouts can be found in <filename>/etc/X11/xkb/base.xml</filename>. To find the value (the two characters) corresponding to a language try searching for the english name of the nation where the language is spoken, e.g:

<screen>$ grep -i sweden -C3 /etc/X11/xkb/base.xml | grep name
	&lt;name&gt;se&lt;name&gt;
</screen>

To get the locale files for swedish generated and a swedish keyboard layout in X use:

<screen>lh_config --bootappend-live "locale=sv_SE.utf8 keyb=se"</screen>

</para>
<para>
A list of the valid values of the keyboards for the console can be figured with the following command:
<screen>for i in `find /usr/share/keymaps/ -iname "*kmap.gz"`; do basename $i | head -c -9; echo; done | sort | less </screen>

To make the console keyboard use a swedish layout use

<screen>lh_config --bootappend-live "locale=sv_SE.utf8 keyb=se-latin1"</screen>

</para>

<section id="persistence">
<title>Persistence</title>
<para>A live cd paradigm is a preinstalled system which runs from a read-only media, like a cdrom, were writes and modifications does not survive reboots of the host hardware which runs it.</para>
<para>A Debian Live system is a generalization of this paradigm and thus supports more media, and not only cds; but stills, in its default behaviour, it should be considered read only and all the runtime evolutions of the system are lost with a shutdown.</para>

<para>Persistence is a common name for different kinds of solutions for saving across reboots some or all of this runtime evolution of the system; to undestand how it could work it could be handy to know that even if the system is booted and runt from a read only media, modification to the files and directories are wrote on a writable media , tipically a ram disk (tmpfs) and ram disk's data do not survive reboots.</para>
<para>The data stored on this ramdisk should be saved in a writable persistent media like on an Hard Disk, a USB key, a network "share" or even a session of a multisession (re)writable CD/DVD. All this cited media are supported in Debian Live in different ways, all but latest one requires a special boot parameter to be specified at boot: <command>persistent</command>.</para>

<section><title>Full persistence</title>
<para>With "full persistence" it is meant that instead of using a tmpfs for storing modifications to the read-only media (with the copy-on-write, COW, system) a writable partition is used. In order to use this feature a partition with a clean writable supported filesystem on it labeled "live-rw" must be attached on the system at bootime and the system must be started with "persistent" boot parameter; this partition could be an ext2 partition on the hard disk or on a usb key created with, e.g.:</para>

<screen>
# mkfs.ext2 -L live-rw /dev/sdb1
</screen>

<para>But since live system users, not always can use an hard drive partition, maybe because they aren't allowed or they wan't to repartition a drive, and considering that most USB keys have laughables write speeds, "full" persistence could be also used with just image files, so you could create a file representing a partition and put this image file even on a NTFS partition of a foreign OS, with something like:</para>

<screen>
$ dd if=/dev/null of=live-rw bs=1G seek=1	# for a 1GB sized image file
$ /sbin/mkfs.ext2 -F live-rw
</screen>

<para>Then copy the <command>live-rw</command> file in a writable partition and reboot with "persistent" boot parameter.</para>
</section>

<section><title>Home automounting</title>
<para>If during the boot a partition (filesystem) image file or a partition labeled  <command>home-rw</command> will be discovered, this filesystem will be directly mounted as <command>/home</command>, thus permitting persistence of files that belong to the e.g. default user. It can be combined with full persistence.</para>
</section>

<section><title>Snapshots</title>
<para>Snapshots are collection of files and directories which are not mounted while running but which are copied from a persistent device to the system (tmpfs) at boot and which are resynced at reboot/shutdown of the system. The content of a snapshot could reside on a partition or an image file (like the above mentioned types) labeled <command>live-sn</command>, but it defaults to a simple cpio archive named <command>live-sn.cpio.gz</command>. As above at boot time, the block devices connected to the system are traversed to see if a partition or a file named like that could be found. A power interruption during runtime could lead to data lost hence a tool invoked  <command>live-snapshot --refresh</command> could be called to sync important changes. This type of persistence since it does not write continuosly to the persistent media is the most flash-based device friendly and the fastest of all the persistence systems.</para>
<para> A /home version of snapshot exists too and its label is <command>home-sn.*</command>; it works the same as the main snapshot but it is only applied to /home.</para>
<para> All kind of snapshots cannot currently handle file deleting while full persistence and obviously home automounting could.</para>
</section>

<section><title>Partial remasterings</title>
<para>The runtime modification of the tmpfs could be collected usign live-snapshot in a squashfs and added to the cd by remastering the iso in case of cd-r or adding a session to multisession cd/dvd(rw); live-initramfs mounts all /live filesystem in order or with the module bootparameter.</para>
